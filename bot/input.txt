Hello fellow Annie enthusiasts,
We come together today to share a most cherished memory from our time in TOK class bonding with Annie 'the man, the myth, the legend' Dutta.
Just to give you all some context, Preethi and I decided to bestow a small token of appreciation upon Annie, a gift acknowledging the deep impact he's had on us all. Said token of appreciation was his laptop, encased in a stunning toilet paper sleeve.
This picture does not capture the tears of joy which Annie shed, but still must be shared with you all.

Best,
Your fellow Annie Enthusiast,
Maanya
